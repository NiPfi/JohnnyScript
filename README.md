# JohnnyScript
This is a Java based compiler used to compile files for the JohnnySimulator by Peter Dauscher which aims to simulate a simplified von Neumann computer but lacks a real assembly language and needs to be programmed by entering instructions into .ram files.
With JohnnyScript, sourcefiles can be commented and instructions can be given in text form which is then compiled to the exclusively numeric .ram file used by the JohnnySimulator.
